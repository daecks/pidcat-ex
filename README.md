PID Cat (extended)
==================

Based on Jake Wharton's excellent [pidcat][1] which filters `adb`
result by application package name.

Basic usage:
```bash
    pidcat-ex com.oprah.bees.android
```
On top of the original [pidcat][1], this fork provides these additional features
<pre>
  --timestamp           Prepend each line of output with the current time.
  --extra-header-width N
                        Width of customized log header. If you have your own
                        header besides Android log header, this option will
                        further indent your wrapped lines with additional
                        width
  --grep WORD_LIST_TO_GREP
                        Filter lines with words in log messages. The words are
                        delimited with '|', where each word can be tailed with
                        a color initialed with '\'. If no color is specified,
                        'RED' will be the default color. For example, option
                        --grep='word1|word2\CYAN' means to filter out all
                        lines containing either 'word1' or 'word2', and
                        'word1' will appear in default color 'RED', while
                        'word2' will be in the specified color 'CYAN'.
                        Supported colors (case ignored): {BLACK, RED, GREEN,
                        YELLOW, BLUE, MAGENTA, CYAN, WHITE, BG_BLACK, BG_RED,
                        BG_GREEN, BG_YELLOW, BG_BLUE, BG_MAGENTA, BG_CYAN,
                        BG_WHITE, NONE}. The color with prefix 'BG_' is
                        background color. And color 'NONE' means NOT
                        highlighting with color. You can have multiple '--
                        grep' options in the command line, and if so, the
                        command will grep all of the key words in all '--grep'
                        options. Escape '|' with '\|', and '\' with '\\'.
  --hl WORD_LIST_TO_HIGHLIGHT
                        Words to highlight in log messages. Unlike '--grep'
                        option, this option will only highlight the specified
                        words with specified color but does not filter any
                        lines. Except this, the format and supported colors
                        are the same as '--grep'. You can have multiple '--hl'
                        options in the command line, and if so, the command
                        will highlight all of the key words in all '--hl'
                        options
  --grepv WORD_LIST_TO_EXCLUDE
                        Exclude lines with words from log messages. The format
                        and supported colors are the same as '--grep'. Note
                        that if both '--grepv' and '--grep' are provided and
                        they contain the same word, the line will always show,
                        which means '--grep' overwrites '--grepv' for the same
                        word they both contain. You can have multiple '--
                        grepv' options in the command line, and if so, the
                        command will exclude the lines containing any keywords
                        in all '--grepv' options
  --igrep WORD_LIST_TO_GREP
                        The same as '--grep', just ignore case
  --ihl WORD_LIST_TO_HIGHLIGHT
                        The same as '--hl', just ignore case
  --igrepv WORD_LIST_TO_EXCLUDE
                        The same as '--grepv', just ignore case
  --rgrep REGEX_LIST_TO_GREP
                        The same as '--grep', just using regular expressions
                        in python style as described in
                        'https://docs.python.org/2/library/re.html'. In the
                        regular expression, make sure to escape '|' with '\|',
                        and '\' with '\\'
  --rhl REGEX_LIST_TO_HIGHLIGHT
                        The same as '--hl', just using regular expressions in
                        python style as described in
                        'https://docs.python.org/2/library/re.html'. In the
                        regular expression, make sure to escape '|' with '\|',
                        and '\' with '\\'
  --rgrepv REGEX_LIST_TO_EXCLUDE
                        The same as '--grepv', just using regular expressions
                        in python style as described in
                        'https://docs.python.org/2/library/re.html'. In the
                        regular expression, make sure to escape '|' with '\|',
                        and '\' with '\\'
  --keep-all-errors     Do not filter any error or fatal logs from 'pidcat-ex'
                        output. This is quite helpful to avoid ignoring
                        information about exceptions, crash stacks and
                        assertion failures
  --tee FILE_NAME       Besides stdout output, also output the filtered result
                        (after grep/grepv) to the file
  --tee-pidcat PIDCAT_FILE_NAME
                        Besides stdout output, also output the unfiltered
                        original pidcat-ex result (all pidcat-ex formatted
                        lines) to the file
  --tee-adb ADB_OUTPUT_FILE_NAME
                        Output original adb result (raw adb output) to the
                        file
  --pipe TERMINAL_WIDTH_FOR_PIPE_MODE
                        Note: you need to give terminal width as the value,
                        just put `tput cols` here. When running in pipe mode,
                        the script will take input from 'stdin' rather than
                        launching adb itself. The usage becomes something like
                        "adb -d logcat | pidcat-ex --pipe `tput cols`
                        com.testapp". This is very useful when you want to
                        apply any third-party scripts on the adb output before
                        pidcat-ex cutting each line, like using 3rd-party
                        scripts to grep or hilight with colors (such as using
                        'ack' or 'h' command) to keywords. For example, "adb
                        -d logcat | h -i 'battery' | pidcat-ex --pipe `tput
                        cols` com.testapp"
  --hide-header HIDE_HEADER_REGEX
                        Remove the header in each line that matches the
                        regular expression. Note that Android adb header is
                        NOT considered here. The parameter is regular
                        expression. When this option provided, the script will
                        match the head of each log line (not including the
                        Android adb header) with the regular expression, and
                        remove the matched header in the output. This is
                        useful when your own log has big long headers in each
                        line which you don't care and want to hide them from
                        the output. The regular expression syntax is in python
                        style as described in
                        'https://docs.python.org/2/library/re.html'. You can
                        specify multiple '--hide-header' options and if the
                        header matches any of them, it will be removed from
                        output
  --addr2line-tool ADDR2LINE_TOOL_PATH
                        This option along with '--addr2line-bin' (you have to
                        give values to both these parameters) will help you
                        automatically symbolicate the native crash addresses
                        found in the log that match your native code binary
                        file with debug information, such as '.so' lib file.
                        'ADDR2LINE_TOOL_PATH' is the path to the 'xxx-
                        addr2line', which should be found in your Android SDK
                        directory.
  --addr2line-bin NATIVE_DEBUG_BIN_FILE_PATH
                        This option along with `--addr2line-tool` (you have to
                        give values to both these parameters) will help you
                        automatically symbolicate the native crash addresses
                        found in the log that match your native code binary
                        file with debug information, such as '.so' lib file.
                        'NATIVE_DEBUG_SO_LIB_FILE_PATH' is the file path to
                        your debug version native binary file with debug
                        symbols in it. You can provide multiple '--addr2line-
                        bin' options to symbolicate crashes of multiple native
                        binary files. The script can automatically match the
                        correct binary file for each crash log line. Note that
                        your 'NATIVE_DEBUG_SO_LIB_FILE_PATH' version has to
                        match the addresses in the crash log, otherwise, the
                        symbolicated result would not be correct
</pre>

If you want to use the `grep`, `highlight` and any other functions
as a stand-alone tool so as to use it with other files or tools,
you can check this one [`hl (A Text Highlighting Tool)`][2]

Here is an example of the output of the following command:
```bash
    pidcat-ex --timestamp --ihl='oslog|logs|sensor\cyan|queuebatch\bg_blue|state\white|latency\bg_green|enable\magenta' --hl='screen\yellow|far\bg_yellow|event\bg_ack'
```
![Example screen](screen.png)

Another example using pipe mode with 3rd-party [`h`][4] tool:
```bash
    adb logcat | h group android call Status Layout system pid event | pidcat-ex --pipe=`tput cols`
```
![Example screen](screen2.png)

You could notice that
 * The words are highlighted in specified colors, even the cut words due to line wrapping (`--hl`);
 * Timestamps are headed in each line (`--timestamp`);
 * Additional indentation spaces are added to align the wrapped lines to the right of timestamp headers (`--header-width`);

Install
-------

Get the script:

 * Download the `pidcat-ex.py` and place it on your PATH.


Make sure that `adb` from the [Android SDK][3] is on your PATH. This script will
not work unless this is that case. That means, when you type `adb` and press
enter into your terminal something actually happens.

To include `adb` and other android tools on your path:
```bash
    export PATH=$PATH:<path to Android SDK>/platform-tools
    export PATH=$PATH:<path to Android SDK>/tools
```
Include these lines in your `.bashrc`, `.zshrc` or `.bash_profile`.

*Note:* `<path to Android SDK>` should be absolute and not relative.

To add support for parsing existing logcat files, add the following to your .bashrc:
Note: This assumes you have replaced an existing `pidcat` installation with
 `pidcat-ex` or renamed `pidcat-ex` to `pidcat`.

```bash
function pidcatf(){
    if [ "$#" -eq 1 ]; then
        cat $1 | pidcat --pipe=`tput cols`
    elif [ "$#" -eq 2 ]; then
        cat $1 | pidcat $2 --pipe=`tput cols`
    else
        echo "Usage: pidcatf <adb logcat file> <optional: package name>"
    fi
}
```
